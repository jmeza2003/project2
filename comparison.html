	<p>This is the Habanero pepper.The tenth most hottest pepper in the world.Its scoville unit is around 200,000 to 350,000.This pepper packs quite punch in terms of flavor and spice almost instantly.As soon as you take that first bite you feel your mouth burning hot and it begging for water and some regret.</p>

	<div class="habanero3">
	<p>This is the birds eye chili pepper.The birds eye chili pepper scoville rating is around 50,000 to 100,000.This pepper also packs quite the punch but unlike the Habanero pepper this pepper creeps up on you like a fake friend. Not saying that this pepper doesn't burn your mouth instantly but it take quite a while to fully kick in.</p>
